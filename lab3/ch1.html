    <h1>Auto Innovation 2019: Our Top Ten Picks</h1>
    <p>For the better part of a century, this exasperating scene has played out in 
        cold-weather locales throughout the world: Following a night of freezing drizzle, 
        you step haltingly to your car in the driveway to warm it up for the morning commute. 
        Your heart sinks and your blood pressure soars as you see that the door lock is frozen shut.</p>

    <p>These apps are among the most noteworthy innovations in automotive 
        technology in the past few years. Here are our top 10 newest inventions
         and services, in no particular order, that would have gotten Karl Benz all revved up.</p>

        <h2>&nbsp&nbspConnected mobile apps</h2>

        <p>Want the latest real-time warnings about accidents, traffic, 
            speed traps, construction delays—even natural disasters? Waze, a live traffic app, becomes 
            more useful as more people in the area are using it. GasBuddy helps your dollar go farther
             as your car sits idling in said traffic. Like Waze, it relies on crowdsourced data via
              users who report gas price information through its app or website.</p>

            <h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTeen driver technology</h3>
            <p>You may have heard of some cars with teenage driver controls. Chevrolet’s teen driver feature notifies you if the car is driven beyond a certain speed, and (gasp!) disables the stereo if seat belts aren’t used.

                Other safety technologies include a Side Blind Zone Alert, Forward Collision Alert and Forward Automatic Braking.
                
                The feature also allows you to track your teen’s driving performance via the industry’s
                 first in-vehicle report card. It tells parents whether safety systems like ABS or forward
                  collision alert were activated while the teen was driving.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStolen vehicle tracking software</h3>
            <p>The numbers are catching up to the crooks. Experts estimate that nearly 46 percent of the
                 750,000-plus motor vehicles projected to be stolen this year will be recovered. Credit automakers 
                 with technology that they are building into their vehicles.

                Technology such as BMW’s Connected Drive or GM’s OnStar protect drivers
                 in two ways. They allow effortless diagnostics, concierge, and post-crash notification
                  for summoning rescue services, and also can be used by police to pinpoint the exact location
                   of a vehicle that is no longer in the owner’s possession.</p>
